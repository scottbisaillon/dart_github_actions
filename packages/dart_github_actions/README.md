A project for writing [Github Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) using a type-safe api rather than yaml.

This project is heavily inspired by [github-actions-kotlin-dart-dsl](https://github.com/krzema12/github-actions-kotlin-dsl),
but aims to fill in some of the gaps that kotlin scripting currently has.

This project is by no means a replacement, rather, it is an alternative.
